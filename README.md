This code simulates the 2D merger of two hypercharged binary neutron stars and the resulting gravitational wave signal:
The code and derivation for the gravitational interaction can be found via HugoGW's repository (https://github.com/HugoGW/Star-merging-and-gravitational-wave-signal).

To calculate the magnetic force interaction I will do the following:

We first start off with the formula for the dipole-dipole interaction: 
$U= \frac{\mu_0 \cdot \overrightarrow[\mu_1] \cdot \overrightarrow[\mu_2] -3(\overrightarrow[\mu_1] \cdot \hat[r])(\overrightarrow[\mu_2] \cdot \hat[r])}{4\pi \cdot r^3} $

To simplify calculations I will assume that both magnetic dipoles have the same magnetic
